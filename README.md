Welcome to my GitHub!
</h3> 
This is where I mostly post research files that I find interest in. I am still a novice but did coded a few project files on my repos. You can check them out. I also love Python and that's why most of the code files are created in python language. 
I'm learning JS now and a couple CSS. I be sure to update them as well in the future. 
  
I post my #100daysofCode on my Twitter so be sure to check it out.

If you find any bug at all, do open up a new issue and I try my best to fix it.

<h4>
NOTE!
</h4>

Some complex and newly created projects may have logs regarding of their development over time. 
I have been pretty poor in writing logs because I write them in a way that only I can understand which is bad and I agree it. 
Therefore, sorry for the poor logs if you ever find a grammer/punctuation mistake! üôè .


<h4>
Update [April/2022]
</h4>
As of April of 2022, multiple repositories had their names and file structure changed. If you are from a link that complies with "Couldn't find this location" or something, well that is the cause. Please note that it had only affected any other websites outside of github. The readme files are updated with the changes.
<h4>
Update [November/2022]
</h4>
Due to the presence of classified code, repostories will have their commit history "wiped out" to ensure that the code security and its secret remains in good hands. In case of such events, special readme notice would be included as well.
