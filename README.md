# Hey there! ðŸ––
<h4>
Name's  Climax_ and welcome to my Github account! <br>

</p>
Fun fact : My real name is <i>Anafo</i> (pronouned: *'Ah'* + *'naf'*). Many people always find it confusing knowing my real name. If you have been though twitter, you may know me as Code_Blender. 
</p>
I prefer people calling me Climax_ since it is shorter and it represents my personality. 
</p>
Right now, my exams are going on.
For that reason I an unable to commit any new programs onto the Github for the time being. 

Once the exams are finished, I be back to the  projects. 


Till then, feel free to navigate the repositories. Some needs update on their readme files but most of their program files are free from bugs. 


If you find any bug at all, do open up a new issue and I try my best to fix it.

My skill tree for May of 2021 are Python, JS and Basic HTML/CSS. <br>
