<h4>
  
Welcome to the Repository where I mostly post research files that I find interest in. I am still a novice but did coded a few project files on my repos. You can check them out. I also love Python and that's why most of the code files are created in python language. 
I'm learning JS now and a couple CSS. I be sure to update them as well in the future. 
  
I post my #100daysofCode on my Twitter so be sure to check it out. 

If you find any bug at all, do open up a new issue and I try my best to fix it.


Oh yeah I forgot. I got a conflicting and a very awkward personality that changes every 24 hours. I'm just saying that out of curiousity. 

  
Below here are the upcoming work that will take place in the repository. 
<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
<p>  


1. No green light to work on the next Python PyQT5 project
2. Updates on PRoject Bankist underway. Readme not made yet. 


Thank you and have a good day.
