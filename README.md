<h4>
  
Welcome to the Repository where I mostly post research files that I find interest in. I am still a novice but did coded a few project files on my repos. You can check them out. I also love Python and that's why most of the code files are created in python language. 
I'm learning JS now and a couple CSS. I be sure to update them as well in the future. 
  
I post my #100daysofCode on my Twitter so be sure to check it out. 

If you find any bug at all, do open up a new issue and I try my best to fix it.
